## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of several key concepts in web development. Here are some examples:

1. **Centering Elements**:
   Using `margin: 0 auto;` to center block elements within their parent container.
   ```css
   .margin {
     max-width: 1440px;
     margin: 0 auto;
     padding: 30px;
   }
   ```

2. **Responsive Design**:
   Utilizing media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
   ```css
   @media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
     .margin {
       max-width: 375px;
       margin: 0 auto;
       padding: 20px;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Typography**:
   Applying custom fonts from Google Fonts and setting font properties.
   ```css
   h1 {
     font-family: "Young Serif", serif;
     font-weight: 400;
     font-style: normal;
     font-size: 300%;
     color: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
   }
   ```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- **Advanced CSS Layouts**: Mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox for complex layouts.
- **JavaScript Integration**: Adding interactivity to static pages.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring my projects are accessible to all users.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - This website has comprehensive guides on various CSS techniques, including Flexbox and Grid.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - An excellent resource for understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in depth.
